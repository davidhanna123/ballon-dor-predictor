# Ballon d'Or Predictor

## Description
The Ballon d'Or Predictor is a web application that simulates the probability of football players winning the prestigious Ballon d'Or award based on their performance metrics. The application consists of a React frontend and a Flask backend. The backend processes player data from a CSV file and performs probabilistic simulations using machine learning techniques, while the frontend displays the results in an interactive interface.

## Features
- Simulates Ballon d'Or probabilities based on player metrics such as goals, assists, matches played, and trophies won.
- Displays simulation results in a user-friendly table format.
- Allows users to trigger simulations directly from the frontend.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- A modern web browser

---

## Installation and Setup

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux:
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
   ```
On Windows:
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Start the Flask backend:
    ```python app.py```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```npm install```

3. Start the React development server:
    ```npm run dev```

## Usage
1. Open the frontend in your browser at `local host address`.
2. Click the "Generate Results" button on the Start Page to navigate to the simulation page.
3. On the simulation page, click "ðŸ”„ Simulate Ballon d'Or" to fetch simulation results from the backend.
4. View the simulation results in the table.

## Troubleshooting
- **Backend Issues**:
  - Ensure the virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.
  - Verify that the Flask backend is running on the right address.

- **Frontend Issues**:
  - Ensure `npm install` was run successfully in the `frontend` directory.
  - Verify that the React development server is running on the right address.

- **CORS Errors**:
  - Ensure `flask-cors` is installed and enabled in the backend.
  - Check the browser's developer tools (Console and Network tabs) for error details.

- **Dependency Issues**:
  - If you encounter missing packages, ensure they are installed in the virtual environment:
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  - For frontend issues, ensure all dependencies are installed:
    ```npm install```
